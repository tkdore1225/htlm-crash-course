        <h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>
        <p>
          First we have Legend of Zelda. Marvelous game indeed, filled my
          childhood with many wonderful memories. It was around 2005 when i
          played my first Zelda game, and boy let me tell you. The music was
          made by an orchestra of angels. It was like God Himself was the
          composer. This music will strike you with the most heavenly feeling of
          nostalgia. Yes, you will not forget this game much less the music for
          as long as you live. Mainly because it is timeless (and it goes viral
          a lot). Im not kidding.

      <h2>Pokemon Soul Silver</h2>
      <p>
        Now we have one of the OG pokemon games every created. So good that they
        remade it with better quality 2016. People liked it that much that that
        had to be done. My naivety got the best of in the original version since
        i was 10 but i dominated the remake, ensuring i captured each and every
        single strong legendary pokemon and destroyed RED. Nonetheless, very fun
        game indeed. Would buy again.

      <h2>Kingdom Hearts</h2>
      <p>
        Last but certainly not least, Kingdom motherfreakin Hearts. Top tier
        game, similar to the other two. Supplies you with an ungodly amount of
        great freakin time. Song nostalgia? Check. Actually good storyline that
        you can relate to deeply in middle school but also in your adulthood?
        Check. This game has it all. It won't be dettered with you buying it
        because of the immense support it gets from it's undying fanbase. Good 
        luck recreating a game like this again much less the other two.
